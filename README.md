🛡️ IoT Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline for IoT intrusion detection. The objective is to apply Data Science and Machine Learning concepts to build a high-performance model capable of automatically classifying Attack type within a real-world IoT infrastructure.

The project was developed as part of Assignment 2 for the course DS at Hassania School of Public Works.
